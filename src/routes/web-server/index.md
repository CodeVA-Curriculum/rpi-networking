# Web Server Mini-Project

## Step 1: Assign Roles

The "extra" computer in your network will be your server. Use a sticky note or a piece of tape to indicate which computer is the server so you don't forget!

## Step 2: Create a Webpage

Use the HTML template & cheat sheet, or just write a normal text file if you aren't comfortable writing HTML

### HTML Cheat Sheet

TODO:

## Step 2: Transfer Your Webpage

Send the webpage file to the main server. Why do this? For practice. You can also just SSH into the server and set it up.

## Step 3: Create the Homepage

Someone who is good at HTML go in and add links to all the webpages. Use `ls` to figure out the names of the `.html` files you need to link to!

### Step 4: Ponder

You've created your own private internet! What rules would you make for it to make sure it stays useful and fun? Collaborate with your group to decide on some rules and guidelines, and then add them to your homepage.

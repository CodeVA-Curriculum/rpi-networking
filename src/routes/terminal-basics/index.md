# Terminal Basics Activity

In this activity, you'll use a application called the **terminal** (or **command line** if you're on Windows) to investigate the devices on your network! You might not be familiar with the terminal, but it's a very common tool (pretty much every computer has one) and it's particularly useful for completing some basic networking tasks.

## What Is the Terminal?

The "terminal" is a software program on your computer. To use it, you'll type in commands to make the computer do things. It's sort of like coding, but instead of typing many commands and running them all at once, you type one command at a time. You can use your terminal for all sorts of things that you might normally do using a mouse and the normal graphical user interface of your operating system; for example:

* Make a folder
* Make a file
* Edit a file
* Delete a folder
* Delete a file
* Navigate the directory structure of your computer

## Using the Terminal

Opening your terminal is different depending on what operating system you're using:

1. Make a folder
2. Enter the folder
3. Make a file in the folder
4. Edit the file
5. Delete the file
6. Delete the folder

Follow the instructions below to try it out, or if you'd like, skip to **Testing Your Lab Network with the Terminal**.

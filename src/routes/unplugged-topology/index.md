# Unplugged Network Mapping

In this activity, you'll create a **network diagram** that you can use as a reference during this workshop. Then, you'll hook up all the hardware for your group's lab network and get ready to test things out! The main **learning objectives** for this activity are the following:

* Familiarize yourself with the terminology associated with networking hardware
* Diagram and set up a simple network with Raspberry Pi computers

Follow the steps below to complete the activity!

## 1. What Do You Have in Front of You?

### Raspberry Pi

This is a tiny computer! It runs a Linux operating system and can do all the cool things your laptop can do, just slower.

### Switch

This is a device that connects computers together to form a *network*, allowing the computers to communicate with one another.

### Ethernet Cables

These cables connect the computers and the switch(es) together. Very important!

### USB-Ethernet Adapter

This adapter will allow you to connect your personal laptop to the lab network for the activities that will follow

## 2. Diagram Your "Lab" Network

Before we start digging in with the hardware and doing some networking, create a paper diagram of what your network will look like. You will be adding to this diagram as you learn more about the devices on the network, so be sure to create the paper version carefully!

1. Use a sticky note to represent each device in the network. Write the name of the device (e.g., Pi, switch) on the sticky note.
2. Connect the sticky notes using twine and clips to represent the cables that will create the network

## 3. Setting Up the Hardware

Now, plug everything in! Use the diagram above as a guide, and feel free to ask for help if you're unsure of something!

## "Plugging In"

Now that everything is hooked up, you need to test your connections and make sure everything is working properly! For that, head over to the next activity, *[Terminal Mapping](/terminal-basics)*.

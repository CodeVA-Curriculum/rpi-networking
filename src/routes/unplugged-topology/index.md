# Unplugged Network Mapping

In this activity, you'll create a **network diagram** that you can use as a reference during this workshop. Then, you'll hook up all the hardware for your group's lab network and get ready to test things out! The main **learning objectives** for this activity are the following:

* Familiarize yourself with the terminology associated with networking hardware
* Diagram and set up a simple network with Raspberry Pi computers

Follow the steps below to complete the activity!

## 1. What Do You Have in Front of You?



## 2. Diagram Your "Lab" Network

Connecting sticky notes together

## 3. Setting Up the Hardware

Don't hook up your computer yet!

## "Plugging In"

Now that everything is hooked up, you need to test your connections and make sure everything is working properly! For that, head over to the next activity, *[Terminal Mapping](/terminal-basics)*.
